As a Ph.D. student in polymer science and engineering, I have a keen interest in the rheological behavior of various complex fluids. Experiments... Theory... Fluid mechanics... Mathematical tools...

### Past Projects

Here are some projects that I worked on as an undergrad:

**Osmotic pressure of polyelectrolyte solutions.** Osmotic pressure is a crucial physical quantity in numerous contexts, including biological phenomena such as water flux in plant vacuoles, and engineering challenges like seawater desalination using membrane methods. For polyelectrolyte solutions with added salt, the existing Donnan equilibrium theory can describe osmotic pressure in most regions. However, it relies on some *a priori* assumptions and may oversimplify the complex electrostatic interactions. Therefore, it is essential to carefully reexamine the system's electrostatics and consider osmotic pressure from a different perspective.

**Swelling of red blood cells.** For decades, theorists and physiologists have sought to explain the biconcave discoid shape of erythrocytes, or red blood cells. Significant progress has been made by considering the bending energy of the lipid bilayer membrane and the competition between limited membrane resources and ongoing biochemical activities. However, another important question is how red blood cells react to environmental changes, such as variations in pH or ionic strength. In this work, we aim to explain how red blood cells change shape in response to external salt concentration by identifying the energy minimum of each state.
