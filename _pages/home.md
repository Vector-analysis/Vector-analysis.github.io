<!--**News: Our group will move to the University of Munich (LMU)!** During the next two years, we will build up a "Lehrstuhl" (chair) at LMU and we will slowly move our instruments to Munich. We will be looking for PhD students, sub-group leaders, postdocs, engineering/technical stuff, and an administrative assistant. Please contact me if you are interested.
More details to follow.-->

Hello! My name is Zhaofeng Peng, currently a fourth-year undergraduate at <a href="https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/">College of Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>. My research interests embrace biology-related soft matter behavior and fluid mechanics in biomedical engineering.

I'm now doing my undergraduate research program about the swelling behavior of red blood cells, advised by Prof. <a href="https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/926688.htm">Guang Chen</a>.

In my free time, I love listening to music and occasionally creating my own. If you're interested, please check out my [gallery]({{ site.baseurl }}/gallery) and give it a listen!

You can find more about me in my [curriculum vitae]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/CV.pdf).<!--({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/Zhaofeng_CV.pdf)-->

<!--We are a dynamic research group, at the [Leiden Institute of Physics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl) and soon at [LMU](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/index.html). Our aim is to explore and understand quantum materials, including strange metals, high-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter. To this end, we develop new quantum sensing and quantum imaging instrumentation to get the key quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)). 


We are very much looking forward to being part of [LMU physics](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/index.html)! We will build up our instruments right in the center of the city, in the “Sommerfeldkeller”, where Sommerfeld himself worked. We will exchange ideas with world class groups working in quantum physics, cold-atom many-body physics, and 2d quantum materials.

Our move to LMU will likely start around Summer 2024, depending on the state of renovations. 

Currently, we are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). 

We are grateful for funding from Leiden University, [LMU ](https://www.lmu.de) [NWO](www.nwo.nl) ([Vidi talent scheme](http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme) and the [Frontiers in Nanoscience program](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-projects/science/frontiers-of-nanoscience-nanofront)), and from an [ERC starting and consolidator grants](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants).

 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
