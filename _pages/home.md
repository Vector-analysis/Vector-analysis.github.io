Hello! My name is Zhaofeng Peng, currently a first-year PhD student in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/polymer-science/">Polymer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">UMass Amherst</a>. <!--My research interests embrace biology-related soft matter behavior and fluid mechanics in biomedical engineering.-->
</div>

<!--I'm now doing my undergraduate research program about the swelling behavior of red blood cells, advised by Prof. <a href="https://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/facultyaz/926688.htm">Guang Chen</a>. For a full list of my projects, please visit the [research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research) page.

In my free time, I love listening to music and occasionally creating my own. If you're interested, please check out my [gallery]({{ site.baseurl }}/gallery) and give it a listen!
