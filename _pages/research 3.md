# Research

As an undergraduate student interested in soft matter fluid mechanics and biomedical engineering, my goal is to attempt to explain certain biological phenomena from the perspective of soft matter physics and explore the potential use of soft matter in biomedical engineering. To start off, I had my eye on a kind of charged soft matter, polyelectrolyte, and embarked on my research journey under the supervision of Professor Guang Chen.

Here are some themes that I currently work on:

**Osmotic pressure of polyelectrolyte solutions.** As we know, osmotic pressure is an important physical quantity to a huge amount of problems, including biological phenomena such as the water flux in plant vacuole, and engineering problems such as seawater desalination with membrane method. For polyelectrolyte solution with added salt, the existing theory of Donnan equilibrium is able to depict its osmotic pressure in most region, but it adapts some *a priori* assumptions and may oversimplify the complicated electrostatic interaction. Thus, it is important to reexamine the electrostatics of the system carefully and consider the osmotic pressure in a different way.

**Swelling of red blood cells.** Theorists and physiologists have attempted to explain the biconcave discoid shape of erythrocyte, or red blood cell, for decades. They have made much progress by considering the bending energy of the lipid bilayer membrane, or the competition between limited membrane resources and ongoing biochemical activities. However, another important question is how the red blood cell reacts to the ambient change, such as a change in pH or ionic strength. In this work, we try to explain how the red blood cell change its shape with external salt concentration by trying to find the energy minimum of the each state.

**Drug sustained release with polyelectrolyte gels.** In recent years, sustained drug release with gels has come into our sight. The complicated electrostatic interaction inside polyelectrolyte gels makes the diffusion coefficient very different from neutral gels. The mechanism for diffusive sustained drug release is yet to be probed. I will try to explore the mechanism for this sustained drug release method. This is the topic for my undergraduate thesis.
