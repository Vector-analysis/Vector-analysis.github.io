$$\int_{\partial\Omega}\omega=\int_{\Omega}d\omega$$

## Comments

Advanced Dynamics:

**Euler-Lagrange equation** For analytical mechanics, this is a faily important equation.

**Einstein's mass-energy relation** Needless to say, this is one of the most famous equations in the world.

**Stokes' theorem** It unifies the fundamental theorem of calculus, Green's formula, Gauss's formula, and so on.
