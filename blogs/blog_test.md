# Research

<!--As an undergraduate student interested in soft matter fluid mechanics and biomedical engineering, my goal is to attempt to explain certain biological phenomena from the perspective of soft matter physics and explore the potential use of soft matter in biomedical engineering. To start off, I had my eye on a kind of charged soft matter, polyelectrolyte, and embarked on my research journey under the supervision of Professor Guang Chen.-->
As an undergraduate student with a keen interest in soft matter fluid mechanics and biomedical engineering, my goal is to explain certain biological phenomena through the lens of soft matter physics and explore the potential applications of soft matter in biomedical engineering. To begin, I focused on a type of charged soft matter known as polyelectrolytes and embarked on my research journey under the guidance of Professor Guang Chen.

## Projects

Here are some themes that I currently work on:

**Osmotic pressure of polyelectrolyte solutions.** <!--As we know, osmotic pressure is an important physical quantity to a huge amount of problems, including biological phenomena such as the water flux in plant vacuole, and engineering problems such as seawater desalination with membrane method. For polyelectrolyte solution with added salt, the existing theory of Donnan equilibrium is able to depict its osmotic pressure in most region, but it adapts some *a priori* assumptions and may oversimplify the complicated electrostatic interaction. Thus, it is important to reexamine the electrostatics of the system carefully and consider the osmotic pressure in a different way.-->Osmotic pressure is a crucial physical quantity in numerous contexts, including biological phenomena such as water flux in plant vacuoles, and engineering challenges like seawater desalination using membrane methods. For polyelectrolyte solutions with added salt, the existing Donnan equilibrium theory can describe osmotic pressure in most regions. However, it relies on some *a priori* assumptions and may oversimplify the complex electrostatic interactions. Therefore, it is essential to carefully reexamine the system's electrostatics and consider osmotic pressure from a different perspective.
